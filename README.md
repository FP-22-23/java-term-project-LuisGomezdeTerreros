- _releaded_Date_, of type LocalDate,  consultable y modifiable. Is the day/month/year of the release.     
- _casting_ , of type Casting, consultable y modifiable . Is a record formed by the 4 actors Casting(String star1,String star2,String star3,String star4 )  

**Constructors**

- C1: Gets all basic properties.   
- C2: Get the properties (String series_title, Integer runtime, Integer imbd_rating, Integer meta_score, Integer no_of_Votes, Double gross)    

**Restictions**:    

- R1" The meta_score has to be between 0 and a 100, "     
- R2 "The imbd_rating has to be between 0 and a 100, "     

**Equality criteria:**

- if the director, released_year, series_title are equal. They are equal.     

**Ordination criteria:**    
 
- Firts compares the imbd_rating, then the meta_score and then the no_of_votes.        

**Auxiliary type:**     

- **Certificate.java** - Is an Enum type of rating certificates of the movies.       
- **Casting.java** - Is a Record with the 4 more important actors.     

### Factory - MovieFactory   

- Factory class for building Movie objects:

-_readMovies (String filename )_ Creates an object of type Movies from the information collected in the csv file, whose path is given as a parameter.        
-_parseLine (String s)_ Receives a type String and does the parse returning a type Movie.       
-_parsegenres ( String gen)_ parses the genres, separaiting them by commas and adding them to a list returning a List<String>               
-_parseRuntime (String runtime)_ parses the runtime, taking out the " min" and converting it to a Intger.          
-_parseCertificate ( String certificate)_  parses the certificates, depending on the String it will assign one of the four different certificates that are.                     

### Type Container - Movies

**Properties:**   
- **List<Movie> Movies**,  consultable and modifiable.                    
  
**Constructors:**            
  - C1: Default constructor. Create a Movies object with no saved games.                      
  - C2: Constructor with a parameter of type Collection<Movie>. Creates an object of type Movies with the movies included in the collection given as a parameter.       
  - C3: Constructor with a parameter of type Stream<Movie>. Creates a Movies object with the movies included in the given Stream   
   
***Equality criteria**.

- _ArrayList<Movie> moreGrossThan (Integer gross )_  Returns a List<Movie> with the movies with a higher gross than the one that it's given to the method.      
- _Map<Integer, List<String>> mapImbdratingmoviesnames()_ Returns a map in which the keys are the Imbd rating and the values and the values a list of titles of movies with that Imbd rating.      
- _Map<Integer , Integer> mapAboveYearGross(Integer year)_  Returns a map in which the key are the years in which movies were released and the values are the gross of all the movies released that year. Filter by movies released after a given year.      
- _Boolean existMovieStreams ( String title)_ Returns a Boolean value True if exist the String title given to method, if it dosen't exist it returns false value. Done with streams.
